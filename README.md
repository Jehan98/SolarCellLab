# SolarCellLab

This project involves design and implementation of a learning environment for an electrical lab in the 
topic of “Factor analysis for achieving high efficiency Solar Cells”. In the electrical lab we look into 
why we need higher efficiencies for solar cells, what are the theoretical limitations associated with solar
cells, how to model a solar cell, how solar cell reflection coefficient, cell temperature, series/parallel 
resistances, shadow patters affect the solar cell efficiency with the help of simulations. The learning 
environment is built using MATLAB Live Scripts and MATLAB Simscape Simulink.
