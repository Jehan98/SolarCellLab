<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
 
This project involves design and implementation of a learning environment for an electrical lab in the topic of “Factor analysis for achieving high efficiency Solar Cells”. In the electrical lab we look into why we need higher efficiencies for solar cells, what are the theoretical limitations associated with solar cells, how to model a solar cell, how solar cell reflection coefficient, cell temperature, series/parallel resistances, shadow patters affect the solar cell efficiency with the help ofsimulations. The learning environment is built using MATLAB Live Scripts and MATLAB Simscape Simulink. The lab file can be shared easily using MATLAB Online platform where the users have the direct access to the materials or can be shared as a file. In that case, the users must have their own MATLAB software installed into the computer to access the lab material. And lab file is compatible across any OS and with any device even with mobile phones.
